This project removes dead code (comments, Plausible analytics), fixes broken tag navigation, and adds content discovery through related posts (OpenAI embeddings), popular posts (Google Analytics API), and a year/month archive page. Production runs MySQL 8.0.27, so embeddings are stored as JSON columns.",
