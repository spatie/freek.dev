<p>In this talk I explain how we leveraged both Laravel and Vue to build the dashboard. After demonstrating the dashboard itself we take a deep dive in the code. We take a look at the entire flow: the grid system, how events are broadcasted using Pusher, some cool Vue mixins and much more. After this talk you\'ll be able to setup your own dashboard using our open sourced code.</p>',

<p>In this talk you\'ll see a practical demo of how to get started with the medialibrary. You\'ll learn how to store files, generate urls to them, how to use different image profiles and how to use external filesystems to store big assets.</p>

If you’re using Laravel you’re going to love this. If you use another framework, come along for the ride and steal some ideas.</p>',
