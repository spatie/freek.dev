    <h1 class="pb-4 border-b">Advertising</h1>

    <p>
    The murze.be blog and newsletter are read by an audience of PHP developers with a heavy interest in Laravel, JavaScript, devops and personal/professional growth. You can get your brand or product in front of that audience by running an ad on the blog and/or newsletter.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you are interested in placing an advertisement on the blog or in the newsletter, or have any more questions, you can email
        me at <a href="mailto:freek@spatie.be">freek@spatie.be</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>The blog</h2>
    In 2017 the blog had 591 113 pageviews. If you want to view some more stastics and learn which we the most popular pages read <a href="https://murze.be/murzebe-turns-three">this blog post</a>.

    <p>
        An advertisement consists of a text with two or three
        sentences that may contain links.. I’ll tag on ” (sponsored)” so it’s clear to the readers that it’s an advertisement.
        Because the blog should come over as very calm, images or logos are not allowed.
    </p>

    <p>An ad can be placed on all pages of the blog or one or more specific posts. It will be place in a white box with a smaller font right above the post tile. The ad will be displayed for at least a month.</p>

    <h2>The newsletter</h2>
    <p>
        The murze.be newsletter is sent out every two weeks to an audience of PHP developers with a heavy interest in
        Laravel, JavaScript and devops.
    </p>

    <p>
        An advertisement
        will run for an entire month (but keep in mind that the newsletter is sent out only once every two weeks).
    </p>

    <p>
        An advertisement consists of a title, a link that goes behind it, and a short description of one or two
        sentences. I’ll tag on ” (sponsored)” to the title so it’s clear to the readers that it’s an advertisement.
        Because the newsletter should come over as very calm, images or logos are not allowed.
    </p>

    <p>
        Currently the subscriber list contains 3500 members. The reported open rate is 55%, the click rate is 25%
    <p>
        I suspect that a large portion of the readers uses software that blocks trackers, so the actual open and click
        rates will probably be a bit higher. Rest assured that, because your ad will be text based, ad blockers will not
        detect or block it.
