        <h1>Advertising</h1>
        <p>
            The freek.dev blog and newsletter are read by an audience of PHP developers with a heavy interest in Laravel, JavaScript, devops and personal/professional growth. You can get your brand or product in front of that audience by running an ad on the blog and/or newsletter.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you are interested in placing an advertisement on the blog or in the newsletter, or have any more questions, you can email me at <a href="mailto:freek@spatie.be">freek@spatie.be</a>.
        </p>
        <h2>The blog</h2>
        <p>
            In 2018 the blog had 728 243 page views. If you want to view some more statistics and learn which pages were the most popular read <a href="https://freek.dev/four-years-of-murzebe">this blog post</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            An advertisement consists of text with two or three sentences that may contain links. I’ll tag on ”(sponsored)” so it’s clear to the readers that it’s an advertisement. As the blog should come over as very calm, images or logos are not allowed.
        </p>
        <p>
            An ad can be placed on all pages of the blog or one or more specific posts. It will be placed in a white box with a smaller font right above the post title. The ad will be displayed for at least a month.
        </p>
        <h2>The newsletter</h2>
        <p>
            The freek.dev newsletter is sent out every two weeks to an audience of PHP developers with a heavy interest in Laravel, JavaScript and devops.
        </p>
        <p>
            An advertisement will run for an entire month (but keep in mind that the newsletter is only sent out once every two weeks).
        </p>
        <p>
            An advertisement consists of a title, a link that goes behind it, and a short description of one or two sentences. I’ll tag on ”(sponsored)” to the title so it’s clear to the readers that it’s an advertisement. As the newsletter should come over as very calm, images or logos are not allowed.
        </p>
        <p>
            Currently the subscriber list contains close to 7 000 members. The reported open rate is 50%, the click rate is 20%
        <p>
        <p>
            I suspect that a large portion of the readers use software that blocks trackers, so the actual open and click rates will probably be a bit higher. Rest assured that, because your ad will be text based, ad blockers will not detect or block it.
