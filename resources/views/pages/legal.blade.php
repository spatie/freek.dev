        <h3>Your privacy is critically important to us.</h3>

        <p>It is Freek.dev's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our
            website. This Privacy Policy applies to <a href="https://freek.dev">https://freek.dev</a> (hereinafter,

            identifiable
            information you may provide us through the Website. We have adopted this privacy policy ("Privacy Policy")
            to
            explain what information may be collected on our Website, how we use this information, and under what
            circumstances we may disclose the information to third parties. This Privacy Policy applies only to
            information
            we collect through the Website and does not apply to our collection of information from other sources.</p>
        <p>This Privacy Policy, together with the Terms and conditions posted on our Website, set forth the general
            rules
            and policies governing your use of our Website. Depending on your activities when visiting our Website, you

        <h2>Website Visitors</h2>
        <p>Like most website operators, Freek.dev collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web
            browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring
            site,
            and the date and time of each visitor request. Freek.dev's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying
            information is to better understand how Freek.dev's visitors use its website. From time to time, Freek.dev
            may
            release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in
            the
            usage of its website.</p>
        <p>Freek.dev also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses
            for
            logged in users and for users leaving comments on https://freek.dev blog posts. Freek.dev only discloses
            logged
            in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses
            personally-identifying information as described below.</p>

        <h2>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
        <p>Certain visitors to Freek.dev's websites choose to interact with Freek.dev in ways that require Freek.dev to
            gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Freek.dev gathers depends
            on
            the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a newsletter at
            https://freek.dev to
            provide an email address.</p>

        <h2>Security</h2>

            means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

            Policy covers the use of cookies by Freek.dev and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>
