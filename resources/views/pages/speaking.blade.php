        <h1>Speaking</h1>
        <p>
            I love public speaking about programming, particulary PHP, Laravel and JavaScript. The past few years I had the honor of speaking at a lot of conferences across the globe.
        </p>
        <p>
            Most of my talks are very practical. I like to make people <i>feel</i> how and why a particular solution works. Below you can view videos of my talks. Some are recorded at conferences, some are recorded in the comfort of my own home.
