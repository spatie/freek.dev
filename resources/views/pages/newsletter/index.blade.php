        <h1>Newsletter</h1>
        <p>
            Every month I send out a newsletter containing lots of interesting stuff for the modern PHP developer.
        </p>
        <p>
            Expect quick tips, links to interesting tutorials, opinions and packages. Because I work with Laravel every
            day there is an emphasis on that framework.

            Every edition of the newsletter contains one or two sponsored links. Hereâ€™s <a href="/advertising">some more
                info</a> on that.
