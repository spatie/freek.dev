        <h1>Music</h1>
        <p>
            I love both listening to and creating music. On this page you'll find some music that I made.

        <p>
            Together with my buddy Thomas, we make music using analog synths. We've already finished a load of tracks
            and are slowly putting them out. They're mostly instrumental, made for adventurous listeners who love
            exploring new sounds.

        <p>
            Every now and then I take some time to record some
            music of my own under my artist name Kobus. If you like indietronica, you'll probably like this.
        </p>

        <ul class="list-none text-gray-700 space-y-4">

        <p>
            Topologies is my currently active band. We converted our rehearsal room to a recording space, and are
            usually crafting songs without the aim of ever performing them live. Expect songs with wild structures, and
            a wide range of instruments and electronics.
        </p>

        <ul class="list-none text-gray-700 space-y-4">
            @foreach($releases['topologies'] as $release)

        </h2>

        <p>
            jarenduren was an Antwerp band, in which I mainly played guitars. Our music was heavily influenced by
            krautrock bands like Neu, Can, My Disco, Harmonia...
