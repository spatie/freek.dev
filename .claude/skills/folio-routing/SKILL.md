# Folio Routing

## When to Apply

Activate this skill when:

- Creating pages with file-based routing
- Working with route parameters and model binding
- Adding middleware to Folio pages

## Documentation

Use `search-docs` for detailed Folio patterns and documentation.

## Basic Usage

Laravel Folio is a file-based router that creates a new route for every Blade file within the configured directory.

Pages are usually in `resources/views/pages/` and the file structure determines routes:

- `pages/index.blade.php` → `/`
- `pages/profile/index.blade.php` → `/profile`
- `pages/auth/login.blade.php` → `/auth/login`

### Listing Routes

You may list available Folio routes using `php artisan folio:list` or using the `list-routes` tool.

### Creating Pages

Always create new `folio` pages and routes using `php artisan folio:page [name]` following existing naming conventions.

<code-snippet name="Example folio:page Commands for Automatic Routing" lang="shell">

// Creates: resources/views/pages/products.blade.php → /products
{{ $assist->artisanCommand('folio:page "products"') }}

// Creates: resources/views/pages/products/[id].blade.php → /products/{id}
{{ $assist->artisanCommand('folio:page "products/[id]"') }}

</code-snippet>

## Named Routes

Add a `name` at the top of each new Folio page to create a named route that other parts of the codebase can reference.

<code-snippet name="Named Routes Example" lang="php">

use function Laravel\Folio\name;

name('products.index');

</code-snippet>

## Middleware

<code-snippet name="Middleware Example" lang="php">

use function Laravel\Folio\{name, middleware};

name('admin.products');
middleware(['auth', 'verified']);

</code-snippet>

## Verification

1. Run `php artisan folio:list` to verify route registration
2. Test page loads at expected URL

## Common Pitfalls

- Forgetting to add named routes to new Folio pages
- Not following existing naming conventions when creating pages
- Creating routes manually in `routes/web.php` instead of using Folio's file-based routing
