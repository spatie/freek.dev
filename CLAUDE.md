## Skills Activation

This project has domain-specific skills available. You MUST activate the relevant skill whenever you work in that domain—don't wait until you're stuck.

- `livewire-development` — Develops reactive Livewire 4 components. Activates when creating, updating, or modifying Livewire components; working with wire:model, wire:click, wire:loading, or any wire: directives; adding real-time updates, loading states, or reactivity; debugging component behavior; writing Livewire tests; or when the user mentions Livewire, component, counter, or reactive UI.
- `pest-testing` — Tests applications using the Pest 4 PHP framework. Activates when writing tests, creating unit or feature tests, adding assertions, testing Livewire components, browser testing, debugging test failures, working with datasets or mocking; or when the user mentions test, spec, TDD, expects, assertion, coverage, or needs to verify functionality works.
- `tailwindcss-development` — Styles applications using Tailwind CSS v4 utilities. Activates when adding styles, restyling components, working with gradients, spacing, layout, flex, grid, responsive design, dark mode, colors, typography, or borders; or when the user mentions CSS, styling, classes, Tailwind, restyle, hero section, cards, buttons, or any visual/UI changes.
- `debugging-output-and-previewing-html-using-ray` — Use when user says &quot;send to Ray,&quot; &quot;show in Ray,&quot; &quot;debug in Ray,&quot; &quot;log to Ray,&quot; &quot;display in Ray,&quot; or wants to visualize data, debug output, or show diagrams in the Ray desktop application.

## Conventions

- You must follow all existing code conventions used in this application. When creating or editing a file, check sibling files for the correct structure, approach, and naming.
- Use descriptive names for variables and methods. For example, `isRegisteredForDiscounts`, not `discount()`.
- Check for existing components to reuse before writing a new one.

## Verification Scripts

- Do not create verification scripts or tinker when tests cover that functionality and prove they work. Unit and feature tests are more important.

## Application Structure & Architecture

- Stick to existing directory structure; don't create new base folders without approval.
- Do not change the application's dependencies without approval.

## Frontend Bundling

- If the user doesn't see a frontend change reflected in the UI, it could mean they need to run `npm run build`, `npm run dev`, or `composer run dev`. Ask them.

## Documentation Files

- You must only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the user.

## Replies

- Be concise in your explanations - focus on what's important rather than explaining obvious details.

=== boost rules ===

# Laravel Boost

- Laravel Boost is an MCP server that comes with powerful tools designed specifically for this application. Use them.

## Artisan

- Use the `list-artisan-commands` tool when you need to call an Artisan command to double-check the available parameters.

## URLs

- Whenever you share a project URL with the user, you should use the `get-absolute-url` tool to ensure you're using the correct scheme, domain/IP, and port.

## Tinker / Debugging

- You should use the `tinker` tool when you need to execute PHP to debug code or query Eloquent models directly.
- Use the `database-query` tool when you only need to read from the database.

## Reading Browser Logs With the `browser-logs` Tool

- You can read browser logs, errors, and exceptions using the `browser-logs` tool from Boost.
- Only recent browser logs will be useful - ignore old logs.

## Searching Documentation (Critically Important)

- Boost comes with a powerful `search-docs` tool you should use before trying other approaches when working with Laravel or Laravel ecosystem packages. This tool automatically passes a list of installed packages and their versions to the remote Boost API, so it returns only version-specific documentation for the user's circumstance. You should pass an array of packages to filter on if you know you need docs for particular packages.
- Search the documentation before making code changes to ensure we are taking the correct approach.
- Use multiple, broad, simple, topic-based queries at once. For example: `['rate limiting', 'routing rate limiting', 'routing']`. The most relevant results will be returned first.
- Do not add package names to queries; package information is already shared. For example, use `test resource table`, not `filament 4 test resource table`.

### Available Search Syntax

1. Simple Word Searches with auto-stemming - query=authentication - finds 'authenticate' and 'auth'.
2. Multiple Words (AND Logic) - query=rate limit - finds knowledge containing both "rate" AND "limit".
3. Quoted Phrases (Exact Position) - query="infinite scroll" - words must be adjacent and in that order.
4. Mixed Queries - query=middleware "rate limit" - "middleware" AND exact phrase "rate limit".
5. Multiple Queries - queries=["authentication", "middleware"] - ANY of these terms.

=== php rules ===

# PHP

- Always use curly braces for control structures, even for single-line bodies.

## Constructors

- Use PHP 8 constructor property promotion in `__construct()`.
    - <code-snippet>public function __construct(public GitHub $github) { }</code-snippet>
- Do not allow empty `__construct()` methods with zero parameters unless the constructor is private.

## Type Declarations

- Always use explicit return type declarations for methods and functions.
- Use appropriate PHP type hints for method parameters.

<code-snippet name="Explicit Return Types and Method Params" lang="php">
protected function isAccessible(User $user, ?string $path = null): bool
{
    ...
}
</code-snippet>

## Enums

- Typically, keys in an Enum should be TitleCase. For example: `FavoritePerson`, `BestLake`, `Monthly`.

## Comments

- Prefer PHPDoc blocks over inline comments. Never use comments within the code itself unless the logic is exceptionally complex.

## PHPDoc Blocks

- Add useful array shape type definitions when appropriate.

=== tests rules ===

# Test Enforcement

- Every change must be programmatically tested. Write a new test or update an existing test, then run the affected tests to make sure they pass.
- Run the minimum number of tests needed to ensure code quality and speed. Use `php artisan test --compact` with a specific filename or filter.

=== laravel/core rules ===

# Do Things the Laravel Way

- Use `php artisan make:` commands to create new files (i.e. migrations, controllers, models, etc.). You can list available Artisan commands using the `list-artisan-commands` tool.
- If you're creating a generic PHP class, use `php artisan make:class`.
- Pass `--no-interaction` to all Artisan commands to ensure they work without user input. You should also pass the correct `--options` to ensure correct behavior.

## Database

- Always use proper Eloquent relationship methods with return type hints. Prefer relationship methods over raw queries or manual joins.
- Use Eloquent models and relationships before suggesting raw database queries.
- Avoid `DB::`; prefer `Model::query()`. Generate code that leverages Laravel's ORM capabilities rather than bypassing them.
- Generate code that prevents N+1 query problems by using eager loading.
- Use Laravel's query builder for very complex database operations.

### Model Creation

- When creating new models, create useful factories and seeders for them too. Ask the user if they need any other things, using `list-artisan-commands` to check the available options to `php artisan make:model`.

### APIs & Eloquent Resources

- For APIs, default to using Eloquent API Resources and API versioning unless existing API routes do not, then you should follow existing application convention.

## Controllers & Validation

- Always create Form Request classes for validation rather than inline validation in controllers. Include both validation rules and custom error messages.
- Check sibling Form Requests to see if the application uses array or string based validation rules.

## Authentication & Authorization

- Use Laravel's built-in authentication and authorization features (gates, policies, Sanctum, etc.).

## URL Generation

- When generating links to other pages, prefer named routes and the `route()` function.

## Queues

- Use queued jobs for time-consuming operations with the `ShouldQueue` interface.

## Configuration

- Use environment variables only in configuration files - never use the `env()` function directly outside of config files. Always use `config('app.name')`, not `env('APP_NAME')`.

## Testing

- When creating models for tests, use the factories for the models. Check if the factory has custom states that can be used before manually setting up the model.
- Faker: Use methods such as `$this->faker->word()` or `fake()->randomDigit()`. Follow existing conventions whether to use `$this->faker` or `fake()`.
- When creating tests, make use of `php artisan make:test [options] {name}` to create a feature test, and pass `--unit` to create a unit test. Most tests should be feature tests.

## Vite Error

- If you receive an "Illuminate\Foundation\ViteException: Unable to locate file in Vite manifest" error, you can run `npm run build` or ask the user to run `npm run dev` or `composer run dev`.

=== laravel/v12 rules ===

# Laravel 12

- CRITICAL: ALWAYS use `search-docs` tool for version-specific Laravel documentation and updated code examples.
- Since Laravel 11, Laravel has a new streamlined file structure which this project uses.

## Laravel 12 Structure

- In Laravel 12, middleware are no longer registered in `app/Http/Kernel.php`.
- Middleware are configured declaratively in `bootstrap/app.php` using `Application::configure()->withMiddleware()`.
- `bootstrap/app.php` is the file to register middleware, exceptions, and routing files.
- `bootstrap/providers.php` contains application specific service providers.
- The `app\Console\Kernel.php` file no longer exists; use `bootstrap/app.php` or `routes/console.php` for console configuration.
- Console commands in `app/Console/Commands/` are automatically available and do not require manual registration.

## Database

- When modifying a column, the migration must include all of the attributes that were previously defined on the column. Otherwise, they will be dropped and lost.
- Laravel 12 allows limiting eagerly loaded records natively, without external packages: `$query->latest()->limit(10);`.

### Models

- Casts can and likely should be set in a `casts()` method on a model rather than the `$casts` property. Follow existing conventions from other models.

=== livewire/core rules ===

# Livewire

- Livewire allows you to build dynamic, reactive interfaces using only PHP — no JavaScript required.
- Instead of writing frontend code in JavaScript frameworks, you use Alpine.js to build the UI when client-side interactions are required.
- State lives on the server; the UI reflects it. Validate and authorize in actions (they're like HTTP requests).
- IMPORTANT: Activate `livewire-development` every time you're working with Livewire-related tasks.

=== pest/core rules ===

## Pest

- This project uses Pest for testing. Create tests: `php artisan make:test --pest {name}`.
- Run tests: `php artisan test --compact` or filter: `php artisan test --compact --filter=testName`.
- Do NOT delete tests without approval.
- CRITICAL: ALWAYS use `search-docs` tool for version-specific Pest documentation and updated code examples.
- IMPORTANT: Activate `pest-testing` every time you're working with a Pest or testing-related task.

=== tailwindcss/core rules ===

# Tailwind CSS

- Always use existing Tailwind conventions; check project patterns before adding new ones.
- IMPORTANT: Always use `search-docs` tool for version-specific Tailwind CSS documentation and updated code examples. Never rely on training data.
- IMPORTANT: Activate `tailwindcss-development` every time you're working with a Tailwind CSS or styling-related task.

=== filament/filament rules ===

## Filament

- Filament is used by this application. Follow existing conventions for how and where it's implemented.
- Filament is a Server-Driven UI (SDUI) framework for Laravel that lets you define user interfaces in PHP using structured configuration objects. Built on Livewire, Alpine.js, and Tailwind CSS.
- Use the `search-docs` tool for official documentation on Artisan commands, code examples, testing, relationships, and idiomatic practices.

### Artisan

- Use Filament-specific Artisan commands to create files. Find them with `list-artisan-commands` or `php artisan --help`.
- Inspect required options and always pass `--no-interaction`.

### Patterns

Use static `make()` methods to initialize components. Most configuration methods accept a `Closure` for dynamic values.

Use `Get $get` to read other form field values for conditional logic:

<code-snippet name="Conditional form field" lang="php">
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Utilities\Get;

Select::make('type')
    ->options(CompanyType::class)
    ->required()
    ->live(),

TextInput::make('company_name')
    ->required()
    ->visible(fn (Get $get): bool => $get('type') === 'business'),
</code-snippet>

Use `state()` with a `Closure` to compute derived column values:

<code-snippet name="Computed table column" lang="php">
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('full_name')
    ->state(fn (User $record): string => "{$record->first_name} {$record->last_name}"),
</code-snippet>

Actions encapsulate a button with optional modal form and logic:

<code-snippet name="Action with modal form" lang="php">
use Filament\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

Action::make('updateEmail')
    ->form([
        TextInput::make('email')->email()->required(),
    ])
    ->action(fn (array $data, User $record): void => $record->update($data)),
</code-snippet>

### Testing

Authenticate before testing panel functionality. Filament uses Livewire, so use `livewire()` or `Livewire::test()`:

<code-snippet name="Filament Table Test" lang="php">
    livewire(ListUsers::class)
        ->assertCanSeeTableRecords($users)
        ->searchTable($users->first()->name)
        ->assertCanSeeTableRecords($users->take(1))
        ->assertCanNotSeeTableRecords($users->skip(1));
</code-snippet>

<code-snippet name="Filament Create Resource Test" lang="php">
    livewire(CreateUser::class)
        ->fillForm([
            'name' => 'Test',
            'email' => 'test@example.com',
        ])
        ->call('create')
        ->assertNotified()
        ->assertRedirect();

    assertDatabaseHas(User::class, [
        'name' => 'Test',
        'email' => 'test@example.com',
    ]);
</code-snippet>

<code-snippet name="Testing Validation" lang="php">
    livewire(CreateUser::class)
        ->fillForm([
            'name' => null,
            'email' => 'invalid-email',
        ])
        ->call('create')
        ->assertHasFormErrors([
            'name' => 'required',
            'email' => 'email',
        ])
        ->assertNotNotified();
</code-snippet>

<code-snippet name="Calling Actions" lang="php">
    use Filament\Actions\DeleteAction;
    use Filament\Actions\Testing\TestAction;

    livewire(EditUser::class, ['record' => $user->id])
        ->callAction(DeleteAction::class)
        ->assertNotified()
        ->assertRedirect();

    livewire(ListUsers::class)
        ->callAction(TestAction::make('promote')->table($user), [
            'role' => 'admin',
        ])
        ->assertNotified();
</code-snippet>

### Common Mistakes

**Commonly Incorrect Namespaces:**
- Form fields (TextInput, Select, etc.): `Filament\Forms\Components\`
- Infolist entries (for read-only views) (TextEntry, IconEntry, etc.): `Filament\Infolists\Components\`
- Layout components (Grid, Section, Fieldset, Tabs, Wizard, etc.): `Filament\Schemas\Components\`
- Schema utilities (Get, Set, etc.): `Filament\Schemas\Components\Utilities\`
- Actions: `Filament\Actions\` (no `Filament\Tables\Actions\` etc.)
- Icons: `Filament\Support\Icons\Heroicon` enum (e.g., `Heroicon::PencilSquare`)

**Recent breaking changes to Filament:**
- File visibility is `private` by default. Use `->visibility('public')` for public access.
- `Grid`, `Section`, and `Fieldset` no longer span all columns by default.
